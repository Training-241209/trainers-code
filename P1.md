For this individual project, you'll create a console application, where the application will be interacting with users via terminal. The project will conclude with a presentation of working software to trainers and colleagues.

## Requirements

- The application should be a C# Console Application
- The application should build and run
- The application should interact with users, and provide some console UI
- The application should demonstrate some input validation
- The application should have unit tests
- The application should persist data to one or more files via serialization 


## Stretch Goals
- Implement Dependency Injection pattern
- Instead of persisting data to a file, use EF framework to persisit data to DB, read and write from it.
